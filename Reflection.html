			<br></b>[HTML]</b><br/>
			<br>Stands for hypertext markup language. It's made of keywords and commands<br/>
			<br>that web designers use for creating websites. It also provides the structure or the way text, pictures,<br/>
			<br>and so on will appear on the website.<br/>
			
				<br></b>[CSS]</b><br/>
			<br>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts.<br/>
			<br>It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. <br/>
			<br>CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.<br/>

			<br>Many people enjoy creating beautiful things that are useful to others; <br/>
			<br>this is what ignites the passion of artists, painters, writers, builders, and all the rest.<br/>
			<br>This was my first time coding, and to be honest, I really enjoyed it.<br/>
			<br>I may have made some mistakes along the way, but the thrill of finally getting it right<br/>
			<br>motivated me to learn more about these two programming languages. <br/>
			<br>I preferred CSS because it allowed me to experiment with different designs and express my own creativity. <br/>
			<br>My work was sloppy at first, and I was stuck, but after experimenting with different commands, <br/>
			<br>I was able to understand their functions and build a decent website.<br/>
			<br>(Well, in my opinion, it was adequate given that it was my first time). <br/>
			<br>So in particular, coding presents the challenge of assembling a predetermined set of tools in such a way <br/>
			<br>that they build either a cohesive system or a better set of tools that can be used to build other things. <br/>
			<br>It's actually very similar to playing puzzle games, which I enjoy as a challenge. <br/>
			<br>The sensation you have when you see the results of your code.<br/>
			<br>You spend time trying to figure out the best logic to get the result, you write it, run it, <br/>
			<br>you get some errors, fix the bugs, run it again, and then you see the output. <br/>
			<br> You can imagine how Archimedes must have felt right now.<br/>
			<br>I may still be lacking in coding skills, but I am eager to learn more programming languages.<br/>
